# Exceeds spec 
  ### At least one piece of functionality has been re factored into a function in its own file
    The task of making graphs, converting of dates to week, the converting of weeks to dates, and the rolling
    mean have all been put into their own functions.
    I'd like for you to specifically look at my rolling mean function as I created it by myself and feel that it       exceeds the expectations of the course. 
  ### The analysis produces the expected output
    The graph created by my function is very close to the one we tried to replicate. All of the limits,
    axis-breaks, axis labels, and more are close to and/or the same as Figure 3.
    
# Collaboration
    I feel that peer feedback went okay, but I found that it did not help me much overall as my project was pretty     close to done. I struggled to give feedback as my partner did not have an up to date version of their project     on github which made most of the feedback I gave obsolete. I did give them in person feedback which I think       helped, such as letting them know that the date range they were using was wrong.
